# **SynergyTune: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach to Personalized Music Recommendation**

## **1. Introduction/Background**

Current music recommendation systems suffer from well-documented challenges such as data sparsity, the cold-start problem, and a superficial understanding of content [5]. This section will discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based filtering (CBF). This project aims to build an advanced hybrid recommendation system that integrates user behavior, song content, and lyrical features by leveraging modern deep learning architectures [1, 2].

## **2. Problem Definition**

Traditional recommendation systems have problems such as **sparse data**, **cold start** (new users/new songs cannot be recommended), and **superficial understanding** of music content [5].

## **3. Methods**

- **Basic technologies include**:
	- **Unsupervised Learning**: Primarily used to process unstructured data like lyrics and extract deep semantic features. Specific methods include using **Sentence-BERT** to generate lyric vectors [3], employing classic text analysis techniques like **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** (LDA) for topic modeling [4], and utilizing **K-Means** for song clustering.
	- **Supervised Learning**: Used for final prediction and recommendation. Models planned for exploration include Neural Collaborative Filtering (**NCF**) [1], **Wide & Deep models** [2], and potentially Graph Neural Networks (**GNN**).
	- **Hybridization Strategy**: Primarily adopting a feature enhancement approach, where all features derived from user behavior, song metadata, and lyric analysis are concatenated and jointly fed into a Deep Neural Network (**DNN**) for training, a strategy central to architectures like Wide & Deep learning [2].
- **Recommended methods update(if time allows):**
	- Use **LightGCN**[6] as the core collaborative filtering model in your solution, replacing NCF.
	- Use **SASRec**[7] or **BERT4Rec**[8] as a module to learn usersâ€™ short-term interests and combine it with **LightGCN**[6] to build a more powerful hybrid model

## **4. Potential Results and Discussion**

- **Core Evaluation Metrics**:
	- **Prediction Accuracy Metrics**: If predicting ratings, **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) and **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) will be used.
	- **Ranking Quality Metrics**: If generating recommendation lists, **Precision@K**, **Recall@K**, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (**NDCG**) will be used, as is standard for evaluating neural ranking models [1].
	- **Qualitative Metrics**: Focusing on improving recommendation Diversity, Novelty, and the ability to mitigate the cold-start problem, which are recognized as key challenges in the field [5].
